# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
# Actor.create({first_name: "Benedict", last_name: "Cumberbatch", known_for: "Sherlock"})
# Movie.create(
#   title: "Alien", 
#   year: 1979, 
#   plot: "The story follows a crew on a spaceship that is terrorized by an aggressive and killer alien.")
# Movie.create(
#   title: "The Breakfast Club", 
#   year: 1985, 
#   plot: "The plot follows a group of teenagers from different high school cliques who spend a Saturday in detention with their strict assistant principal.")
